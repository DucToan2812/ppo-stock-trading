# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Trading Optimization System

This project is a capstone for the Reinforcement Learning course at FPT University, focused on building a stock trading optimization system using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) â€“ a state-of-the-art algorithm in policy gradient methods. We utilize historical stock data from GOOGL to train and evaluate the model's performance in dynamic market conditions.

##ðŸ“† Timeline

The project was conducted from May to June 2024, covering the stages of data collection, environment design, model implementation, performance analysis, and investment strategy evaluation.
